Teachings of Islam: A Detailed Overview

Page 1: Foundations of Faith
Islam, derived from the Arabic word “Salaam,” means peace and submission to the will of Allah. A Muslim is one who submits to Allah’s guidance. The core beliefs are encapsulated in the Six Articles of Faith:
1. Belief in Allah – the one, unique, and merciful Creator.
2. Belief in Angels – spiritual beings who carry out divine tasks.
3. Belief in Divine Books – including the Qur’an, Torah, Gospel, and Psalms.
4. Belief in Prophets – from Adam to Muhammad (peace be upon them all).
5. Belief in the Day of Judgment – accountability for one’s actions.
6. Belief in Divine Decree – Allah’s knowledge and control over all things.

Islam teaches that humans are born pure and are responsible for their own actions. There is no concept of inherited sin. Each person has direct access to God without intermediaries.

The Five Pillars are the foundation of Muslim practice:
1. Shahada – Declaration of faith: “There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is His messenger.”
2. Salah – Five daily prayers that connect the believer to Allah.
3. Zakat – Charity, a fixed portion of wealth given to the needy.
4. Sawm – Fasting during Ramadan, promoting empathy and self-discipline.
5. Hajj – Pilgrimage to Mecca, required once in a lifetime if able.

These practices foster spiritual growth, social responsibility, and unity. Islam emphasizes intention (niyyah) and sincerity in all acts of worship.

Page 3: Ethics, Justice, and Social Harmony
Islam promotes justice, compassion, and honesty. The Qur’an commands fairness in trade, kindness to neighbors, and care for orphans and the poor. Lying, cheating, and oppression are strictly forbidden.

Men and women are spiritually equal before Allah. Islam encourages education, modesty, and mutual respect. The Prophet Muhammad said, “The best among you are those who are best to their families.”

Islamic law (Sharia) is based on the Qur’an and the Prophet’s teachings. It aims to preserve life, intellect, faith, property, and lineage. It is not a rigid or violent system, but a framework for ethical living.

Page 4: Misconceptions and Clarifications
Misconception 1: Islam promotes violence.
Clarification: Islam permits self-defense but forbids aggression. The Qur’an says, “If they incline to peace, then incline to it also” (8:61). The Prophet forbade harming civilians and destroying crops even during war.

Misconception 2: Women are oppressed.
Clarification: Islam granted women rights to inheritance, education, and consent in marriage over 1400 years ago. Cultural practices that oppress women are not Islamic.

Misconception 3: Muslims worship Muhammad.
Clarification: Muslims revere Muhammad as the final prophet but worship only Allah. The Shahada affirms monotheism.

Misconception 4: Islam is intolerant of other religions.
Clarification: The Qur’an says, “There is no compulsion in religion” (2:256). Islam recognizes Jews and Christians as “People of the Book” and encourages respectful dialogue.

Page 5: The Purpose of Life and the Path to Peace
Islam teaches that the purpose of life is to worship Allah and serve humanity. Worship includes prayer, charity, and ethical conduct. Serving others is seen as a form of devotion.

The Qur’an encourages reflection, gratitude, and humility. It invites people to seek knowledge and act with wisdom. Muslims are taught to forgive, be patient, and strive for peace.

Islam is not just a religion but a complete way of life. It offers guidance for personal growth, family relations, community building, and global harmony. Its message is universal: peace through submission to the Creator, and justice through compassion for creation.
